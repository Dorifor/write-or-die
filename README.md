# 📝 or 💀

The most chill writing app you'll encounter, need to write an essay ? an article ? a testament ? 
With this you can't miss, it's **one shot** or **nothing** !

You set your own rules : 
- Write for a set period of time
- Write a set number of words
- Write a set number of characters

But focus ! If you don't write for just some seconds, the page disappears along with your words, no more excuses !
